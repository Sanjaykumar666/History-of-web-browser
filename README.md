                                                         HISTROY OF WEB BROWSER
  
There’s an entire history of web browsers. Before the web browsers we knew today, there were the first browsers, which are no longer in use or have highly evolved.
•	1990 – The WorldWideWeb (not to be confused with the World Wide Web) was the first browser ever created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed Nexus to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. Unlike today, this was the only browser and the only way to access the web.
•	1992 – Lynx was a texted-based browser that couldn’t display any graphic content.
•	1993 – Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text making it “the world’s first most popular browser”.
•	1994 – A noticeable improvement to Mosaic came Netscape Navigator.
•	1995 – Internet Explorer made its debut as Microsoft’s first web browser.
•	1996 – Opera started as a research project in 1994 that finally went public two years later. This was also arguably the beginning of the browser wars, mainly between IE 3 and Navigator 3 as Internet Explorer inched ahead with new capabilities.
•	2003 – Apple’s Safari browser was released specifically for Macintosh computers instead of Navigator.
•	2004 – Mozilla launched Firefox as Netscape Navigator faded out.
•	2007 – Mobile Safari was introduced as Apple’s mobile web browser and continues to dominate the iOS market.
•	2008 – Google Chrome appeared to soon take over the browser market.
•	2011 – Opera Mini was released to focus on the fast-growing mobile browser market.
•	2015 – Microsoft Edge was born to combat Google.
